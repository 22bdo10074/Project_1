# Air quality monitoring system

## Air quality monitor measuring multiple ambient parameters:
including PM1, PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, SO2, NO2, O3, and H2S, along with Ambient Noise, Light, UV, Temperature, and Humidity.

## Benefits of Air quality monitoring system:
AQM plays a critical role in protecting public health, preserving the environment, and promoting sustainable development by monitoring air quality,
informing decision-making, and fostering collaboration among governments, industries, communities, and other stakeholders.

## Features of Air Quality Monitoring system:

### Certainly, here are the features of Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMs):

Real-time monitoring capabilities,
Measurement of multiple pollutants simultaneously,
Integration of remote sensing technologies,
Logging and storage of air quality data,
User-friendly data visualization tools,
Alerting and notification mechanisms,
Calibration and quality control functions,
Geospatial analysis capabilities,
Integration with weather monitoring systems,
Compatibility with mobile devices,
Access to historical data archives,
Support for regulatory compliance reporting,
Customization and scalability options,
Support for data sharing and collaboration,
Technical support, maintenance, and updates.

## Sensors used in this project:
DHT11, MQ135, ESP8266, ESP32.
### These IoT sensors are equipped with connectivity options 
such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, or cellular (e.g., 4G/5G),
allowing them to transmit data wirelessly to a central data collection system 
or cloud platform for real-time monitoring, analysis, and remote management.
